## NASA project looking at dissolved organic carbon in seawater under sea ice

For the moment the only file in here is the one used to make the SeaBASS *sb file in preparation for submitting the data to NASA's SeaBASS repository; the file is ([make_SeaBASS_file.m](https://github.com/redbluewater/carbonUnderIce/blob/main/make_SeaBASS_file.m)) 

I propose to call this experiment 'PB_seaice' and I have three 'cruises' (using NASA's terminology): {'PBcarbonUnderIce19','PBcarbonUnderIce22','PBcarbonUnderIce23'}, one cruise for each year of samples. As needed, the work of the other PIs can be different cruises.
